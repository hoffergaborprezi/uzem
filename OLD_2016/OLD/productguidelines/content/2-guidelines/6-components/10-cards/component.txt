Title: Cards

----

Short: A Card is a UI block that represents a (usually complex) piece of a collection that cannot be displayed as is, or needs to be derived.

----

Text: The main action on a Card is to open the content behind and the Card itself gives the opportunity to attach secondary information and/or functions.

One Card consists of three parts.
Content (this contains the representation of the content piece behind the card)
Context (this gives the card a context, places it in a collection, can be a title, description, caption, etc. However, this is optional if the content part is enough)
Trigger (to be able to have complex interactions, you can attach additional functions and information to a Card, triggered by this part of it - this is also optional.)

The main concept contains three options regarding size and function
Standard card

Small card

Vertical cards


### Content
It should represent what's "behind" the card, it is a window to the whole content yet to be revealed. It can be any type and any size.
Should be derived from the content of what the card represents
Should be in a short, compact, comprehensive form
Can be the same ratio or can be cropped as long as it helps collection or understanding
Can have states, statuses, that should be clear on the content area.


### Context
It should represent the connection between this content piece and the collection, also it should also describe and give a hint about what the card is derived from or what happened with it.


### Trigger
It represents the way to trigger/reveal secondary information and actions. Most of the time it is revealing further options, but in especially small Card cases it can also be used as a standalone action, in this case it can even be the same as the primary action as an assurance. 

If absolutely necessary, you can put more than one trigger on a card, but in this case they have to be standalone and not reveal other options.

Example of using the card for representing a prezi in Prezi for Mac native   

And with the trigger actions hidden behind a more button
