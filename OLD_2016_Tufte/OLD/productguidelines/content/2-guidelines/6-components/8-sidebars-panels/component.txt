Title: Sidebars & Panels

----

Short: [MISSING CONCEPT DESCRIPTION]

Text: ### Sidebars
Sidebars in Prezi are used either to display the storyline of the presentation (the 'Path sidebar') or typically to show a high number of items in a grid or list which are required to be browsed ('Browse' sidebars), for example an image browse or a favorites sidebar. Sidebars visually are opened from either side of the window towards the center of the screen (not like a drawer).


### Browse Sidebars
A browse sidebar is typically opened with an animation from the right side of the application window and contains a header and a mixture of content and/or control blocks that contribute to the sidebar's functionality. 


#### Sidebar Header
The header is usually dark and features a centered title that clearly identifies the sidebar and a close button. 


#### Sidebar Content
The content area blocks can be:
A set of controls (e.g. a search field with a submit button)
One, or multiple array(s) of similar items (e.g. the result of an image search query arranged in groups with headings)
Information (e.g. when there's no result for an image search)

There can only be one browse sidebar open at a time, i.e. when a new one is triggered the other one closes. To see more details about how to switch between the sidebars please check the Motion chapter.


### Sidebar Container Types
#### Grid
Grid container features content elements with exactly the same size. We use a grid container typically when the content has the same aspect ratio or the user is familiar with the content and it's not a problem to crop the element to the same size. 

#### Board
A board container features content elements with different sizes or ratios. We use it when it's important to show content in full size and with original ratio, typically for images.

#### Folders
We use folder container type when the content is categorized and the categories help finding the needed content. This container features an inner navigation within the panel.

#### Mixed
The mixed container is typically used when more than one type of content has to be displayed in groups. A typical use case is the inspiration panel. This container features an inner navigation within the panel.


### Popovers
A popover is a contextual popup dialog that is visually attached to a UI control (origin). They are like a mixture of simple dropdown lists and the sidebars: popovers usually feature either the same content types (grids, lists of objects) as the sidebar or any kind of rich content. All popovers are modal, i.e. a click triggered outside the popover hides it. The modality of popovers also implies that they in most of the cases don't feature submit and/or dismiss (cancel) buttons. 

There can only be one popover open at a time and also opening a popover from another one should be avoided.

    Small - 168px
    Standard - 318px
    Wide - 438px
