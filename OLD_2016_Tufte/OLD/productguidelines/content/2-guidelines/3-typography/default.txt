Title: Typography

----

Short: The main typeface of Prezi products is Noto Sans that is "designed with the goal of visual harmony across multiple languages". Combined with Raleway - as an outlook to a signiture element of our brand - we achieve a readable, professional yet inviting typographic system.

----

Text: Standard font sizes work best when combined with a leading value that is derived from 3px therefore we use this value for type baseline.
