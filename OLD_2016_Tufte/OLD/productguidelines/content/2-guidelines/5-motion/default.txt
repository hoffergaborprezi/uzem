Title: Motion

----

Short: Motion is a signature element of Prezi. Just like in prezis we use it with meaning on the interface as well: for making the product more understandable, approachable and delightful.

Text: ### Explaining Functions
Use animations to explain spatial relations & hierarchy, sources and results of elements and their related actions. Animation communicates where the sidebar panel comes from and when closing, it shows where it can be re-opened from. By animating the build up process, we also highlight the important actions.


### Driving Focus
Explain navigation, transitions, and state changes while driving attention to important places and functions. Use animation to concentrate attention to important decisions with a popover (e.g. cancel animates back up, done animates onward down). 


### Approachable
Animation should feel familiar (use physical metaphors and real world examples, real world timing: ~.35 sec), ease the start and end of an animation (small bounces, some randomness and slight delays help to achieve the human touch). For example to pull down a canvas you need to pull a little more and then let it go up a bit.


### Delightful
Create a lively and friendly UI that shows we care about the user (to set a general good mood). Rotate the save icon every now and then to make the user feel comfortable while working


### Examples
